## Details

These codes are used to derive ligand-receptor interactions for the mouse cuprizone snRNA-seq data using the CellChat secreted signaling ligand-receptor database.  There is also code provided for performing visualization on the CellChat ligand-receptor results.  These codes have been modified for ease of reading for the end user to repeat analyses however they choose by setting a working directory.  Shell scripts to call these codes on Edge HPC have not been included.  Codes are numbered numerically in the order they were performed.
